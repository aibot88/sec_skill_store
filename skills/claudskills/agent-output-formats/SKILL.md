# Agent Output Formats

## When to use this skill

Activate when:

- A consumer has run a SfSkills runtime agent and needs the result in a format beyond the canonical markdown+JSON (e.g. Excel for a security review meeting, PDF for a compliance audit, Notion card for a team wiki, ServiceNow ticket for tracking remediation).
- A request comes in to "export the agent's output as X" where X is not markdown or JSON.
- You want to avoid the pattern where the consuming AI regenerates the report from scratch in the new format, OR installs new libraries into the user's project.

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Authoring a new agent's primary output format (use `agents/_shared/DELIVERABLE_CONTRACT.md`).
- Designing a new agent's native output shape (use `agents/_shared/schemas/output-envelope.schema.json`).
- Large-scale data exports from Salesforce orgs (use `skills/data/bulk-api-2-patterns`).

## Core principle — convert, don't regenerate

Every runtime agent produces a **canonical pair**: markdown + JSON envelope. That pair IS the source of truth. When a consumer asks for Excel/PDF/etc., the correct answer is to convert from that pair, not to re-run the agent with different instructions.

Reasons:

1. **Reproducibility** — the canonical deliverable is checked into `docs/reports/`. Six months later, anyone can regenerate the Excel from it. If the consuming AI regenerates by re-asking the agent, the output may differ due to LLM stochasticity.
2. **Auditability** — the `run_id` in the envelope is the tracking key. The Excel/PDF should reference it in its header, so "which run produced this?" is always answerable.
3. **Minimal dependencies** — reinstalling `exceljs`, `xlsxwriter`, `weasyprint`, etc. into a consumer's project every time someone wants a different format bloats their project's dependency tree.

## Conversion decision tree

```
START: Consumer wants deliverable in format X.

Q1. Is X markdown or JSON?
    → Already the canonical form. No conversion needed; hand them the file path.

Q2. Is X a format the consumer's existing tooling handles natively?
    ├── Slack message / email body → paste the TL;DR + envelope-link from the markdown
    ├── Confluence / Notion / Obsidian → import the markdown directly (all support markdown import)
    ├── Jira / ServiceNow ticket → paste TL;DR in description + link the report file
    └── GitHub issue → embed markdown inline; link the report path
    → Prefer this path. Zero new dependencies.

Q3. Does the consumer want a "table" from the markdown?
    ├── CSV: extract markdown tables using `pandoc` (most dev machines have it)
    ├── Excel from the JSON envelope: use `jq` + `csv2xlsx` CLI tools (lighter than a full SDK)
    └── If neither pandoc nor jq: recommend installing pandoc (1 tool, system-level, widely used)

Q4. Does the consumer want PDF?
    → `pandoc <report>.md -o <report>.pdf` — single command, no new project deps
    → If pandoc isn't available: recommend a system-wide install, NOT a project-level dep

Q5. Does the consumer want something format-specific (e.g. ServiceNow change ticket)?
    → Extract the fields from the JSON envelope (it's keyed for exactly this)
    → Template into the target system via its normal integration path
    → Do NOT ask the agent to regenerate in the target format
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Confirm the canonical deliverable exists** — `docs/reports/<agent-id>/<run_id>.{md,json}`. If not, run the agent first.
2. **Check the consumer's tooling** — do they already have `pandoc`, `jq`, `csv2xlsx`? The answer is almost always yes for #2 and often for #1.
3. **Walk the decision tree above.**
4. **Produce the conversion command** — a one-liner the user runs in their shell, not code added to their project.
5. **Include the canonical `run_id`** in the converted artifact's header — so auditors can trace it back.
6. **Record the conversion path** in the team's docs — next person who asks has a precedent.

## Key patterns

### Pattern 1 — Markdown → PDF via pandoc

```bash
pandoc docs/reports/user-access-diff/2026-04-17T21-14-05Z.md \
    -o ~/Desktop/user-access-diff.pdf \
    --metadata title="User Access Diff — Christina vs Carrie" \
    --metadata date="2026-04-17"
```

Zero project dependencies added. Works because pandoc is a widely-available system tool.

### Pattern 2 — JSON envelope → Excel via jq + csv2xlsx

```bash
# Extract the findings array from the envelope as CSV.
jq -r '.findings | (map(keys) | add | unique) as $keys |
       ($keys | @csv), (.[] | [.[$keys[]]] | @csv)' \
    docs/reports/user-access-diff/2026-04-17T21-14-05Z.json \
    > /tmp/findings.csv

# Convert to xlsx.
csv2xlsx /tmp/findings.csv /tmp/findings.xlsx
```

Or, if the user has Excel open:
```bash
open /tmp/findings.csv          # macOS; Excel imports CSV natively
```

### Pattern 3 — Envelope → ServiceNow change request

Extract the fields ServiceNow needs from the envelope:

```bash
jq '{
    short_description: .summary,
    description: .summary + "\n\nRun ID: " + .run_id +
                 "\nConfidence: " + .confidence +
                 "\nFull report: " + .report_path,
    priority: (if .findings | map(.severity) | any(. == "P0") then "1"
               elif .findings | map(.severity) | any(. == "P1") then "2"
               else "3" end)
}' docs/reports/<agent-id>/<run_id>.json
```

Paste the JSON into the ServiceNow integration payload. No project deps.

### Pattern 4 — Notion / Obsidian / Confluence import

All three accept markdown imports directly. The user uploads the `.md` file via the platform's UI.

Preservation tip: include the `run_id` as a frontmatter field at the top of the markdown report, so when the page is imported, the run_id survives as a property.

### Pattern 5 — When conversion requires a heavy dependency

Scenario: user wants interactive Excel with embedded formulas referencing cells.

- Don't install `exceljs` / `openpyxl` into their project.
- Recommend they open the CSV in Excel and author the formulas there — the CSV round-trips fine.
- If they insist on scripted generation, recommend a one-off Python script in `~/bin/` or a dedicated report-tool project — NOT the project where the agent was invoked.

## Bulk safety

When converting reports for multiple runs in a batch:

- Use `find docs/reports/<agent-id>/ -name '*.md' -exec pandoc ...` to iterate, not one-by-one invocations.
- If converting to a centralized destination (e.g. uploading 50 reports to Notion), respect API rate limits.
- Never batch-convert and delete the canonical markdown — always retain the source.

## Error handling

- Canonical deliverable missing → refuse to convert. Run the agent first.
- Conversion tool missing → recommend system-wide install, not project-local.
- Target format can't represent a field from the envelope (e.g. nested arrays in Excel) → flatten in the CSV step, not by regenerating.

## Well-Architected mapping

- **Operational Excellence** — standardized conversion paths reduce "how do I turn this into Excel?" support tickets.
- **Reliability** — conversion-not-regeneration preserves the canonical `run_id` as the auditable thread.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Re-asking the agent to regenerate in the new format.** The agent is an expensive LLM call. Conversion is a cheap shell command. Always convert from the canonical.

2. **Installing format-specific libraries into the user's project.** `exceljs`, `xlsxwriter`, `weasyprint` — these are conversion tools, not project dependencies. Install system-wide or run from a dedicated CLI project.

3. **Stripping the `run_id`.** The converted artifact must reference it somewhere (header, filename, metadata). Without it, nobody can trace which run the Excel came from.

4. **Opening up new output-format surfaces on the agent itself.** If someone asks for "JIRA native format" as an agent output, refuse. The agent outputs canonical markdown+JSON. JIRA conversion is downstream.

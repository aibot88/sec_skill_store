# Lint Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for security and readiness issues before cluster deployment with KubeLinter

Run a static policy pass over Kubernetes YAML before misconfigurations, missing limits, or risky defaults reach a cluster.

## Prerequisites

KubeLinter binary or container image, Kubernetes YAML or Helm/Kustomize inputs, and optional CI integration.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

Install command or upstream instructions:

```
Install KubeLinter from the upstream binary, package manager, or container image, run kube-linter lint against the target manifests or chart output, and review the recommendations before deployment.
```

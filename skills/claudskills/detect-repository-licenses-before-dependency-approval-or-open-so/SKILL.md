# Detect repository licenses before dependency approval or open-source due diligence

Use Licensee when an agent needs to inspect a repository and determine what license text it actually matches before a dependency is approved or a codebase is redistributed. The skill is about evidence-backed license detection, not legal advice or broader compliance automation.

## Prerequisites

Ruby and RubyGems, or Docker for containerized runs

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

Install command or upstream instructions:

```
gem install licensee
```

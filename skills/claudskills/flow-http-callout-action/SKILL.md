# Flow HTTP Callout Action

Flow HTTP Callouts (GA) let admins call GET/POST/PATCH endpoints without Apex. You define the action against a Named Credential, supply a sample response for schema, and map inputs/outputs in flow variables. This skill covers auth, schema inference, pagination, and error handling.

## When to Use

Low-volume admin-driven integrations (weather lookup, address verification, single-record enrichment). Not for high-volume or complex transactions.

Typical trigger phrases that should route to this skill: `flow http callout`, `call rest api from flow`, `flow without apex integration`, `named credential flow callout`.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a Named Credential for auth (JWT, OAuth, or API Key).
2. In Flow → New Action → HTTP Callout. Pick the NC, method, path.
3. Provide a sample request + sample response; Flow infers the schema.
4. Reference the action in your flow; map inputs and consume outputs.
5. Add fault path on the action → handle 4xx/5xx (e.g., message screen on error).

## Key Considerations

- Named Credential must be External Credential + Principal type — the old flavor doesn't work.
- Schema inference is rigid; complex nested JSON may require Apex wrapper.
- No automatic pagination handling — you loop.
- Transaction timeout applies to callouts inside record-triggered flows.

## Worked Examples (see `references/examples.md`)

- *Address verification* — Lead capture
- *Weather lookup* — Field service dispatch

## Common Gotchas (see `references/gotchas.md`)

- **NC version mismatch** — Callout fails auth.
- **Complex JSON** — Schema infer misses nested fields.
- **No fault path** — Flow fails to user.

## Top LLM Anti-Patterns (full list in `references/llm-anti-patterns.md`)

- Apex for trivial GET
- Legacy Named Credential
- No fault path
